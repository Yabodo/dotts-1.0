                                <p>Currently, various browsers — such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer
                                    a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header,
                                    which sends a signal to Web sites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT
                                    preference setting. dotts.org does not currently commit to responding to browsers'
                                    DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common
                                    industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies
                                    or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent.
                                    dotts.org takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to
                                    continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
                                    implementation of a standard.</p>
